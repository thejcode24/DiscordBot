# DiscordBot
A basic Discord bot that uses discord.py, the Python 3 API wrapper for the popular gaming chat program Discord, which takes user commands and does basic activities such as using the GIPHY API to display a random GIF based on a search keyword inputted by user.
My goal is to keep adding different functionalities using various free APIs and unittesting for debugging.

The purposes of this bot is for learning purposes only (and also to have some fun with my friends on Discord :).
