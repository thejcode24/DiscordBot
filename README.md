# DiscordBot
A basic Discord bot that uses discord.py, the Python 3 API wrapper for the popular gaming chat program Discord, which takes user commands and does basic activities such as using the GIPHY API to display a random GIF based on a search keyword inputted by user. The purposes of this bot is for learning purposes only (and also to have some fun with my friends on Discord :).
